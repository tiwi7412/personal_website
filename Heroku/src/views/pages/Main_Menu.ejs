	<p>
		A simple battleship game created on QTCreator in c++. Made for a project with a partner, Ben Ellis.
		This game allows two people to alternate turns placing ships, and then attacking the others. Each players
		game board is hidden from their opponent until the turn is changed and the correct player chooses to show
		their board.
